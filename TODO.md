# TODO List

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **admin-list** - Add admin page to list users from `subbase` table
- [x] **admin-protect** - Protect /admin route to admin users only

## Current Status

Both admin-related tasks have been completed:
1. ✅ The admin page now reads from the `subbase` table and displays users in a table format
2. ✅ The `/admin` route is protected and only accessible to authenticated users with proper role-based access control

## Implementation Details

- **AdminPage.tsx**: Updated to fetch from `subbase` table instead of `profiles`
- **Data Mapping**: Added safe data transformation for table display
- **Route Protection**: `/admin` route is wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Role-based Access**: Uses existing `RoleBasedRedirect` for role validation
- **MCP Integration**: Added placeholder MCP sync button with toast notifications
- **UI Enhancements**: Maintained existing design patterns and color scheme from Style.png

## Next Steps

The admin functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can:
- View all records from the `subbase` table
- Filter by role and search by name/operator ID
- See statistics and counts for different user types
- Access role-based navigation and actions
